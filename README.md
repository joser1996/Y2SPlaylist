# Y2SPlaylist
Currently the shell.py program allows you to take an existing YouTube playlist
and link it to an existing Spotify Playlist. Whenever you synchronize songs from
your YouTube playlists are pulled and then they are pushed to corresponding spotify
playlists. 

Currently you can link multiple youtube playlists to multiple spotify playlists.  

## Planned Additions
* Working on the ability to remotely create or delete playlists on either Spotify or YouTube.  
* Currently can only modify public YouTube playlists that you own. In the future will include 
  private plyalists as well
* Parsing YouTube title videos can be imporoved to improve query results on Spotify.
* UI/UX
